# 100daysPy

<h1>Introduction</h1>
The following GitHub repository is a collection of the code I produced during the completion of the coding bootcamp "100 Days of Code with Python" created by Dr. Angela Yu as a course provided on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/). For those concerned, much of this code is not a one-to-one copy of the code provided in the teaching materials of the course generated by Angela. Most of the code is mine, and therefore it reflects my idiosyncratic, warts-and-all attempts to solve the problems, or even to extend the problems and learnings presented in the bootcamp. Hopefully, this repository can be a continuously updated document of my experience with Python programming, or if not, a memorial to how bad my code was! Of course, that leaves the hopeful postive that my python programming skills must have gotten better with time.
